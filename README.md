# Total Witcher Trivia Game

### Coding Bootcamp Project

##### Description
  This project was designed to showcase skills using JavaScript and Jquery with an emphasis on the ability to use timers and DOM manipulation.
  
  I used The Witcher theme as a suggestion from one of my friends. The overall design of this project could definitly use some improvement to make it more estitically pleasing. 
  I ran into quite a bit of difficulty with this project which resulting in restarting multiple times. By the end of it I fully understood timers and DOM manipulation which that was a plus.
